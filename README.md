## 📌 What is TheWiz-PS5-Easy-FFpkg-Maker?

TheWiz-PS5-Easy-FFpkg-Maker is a desktop app designed to help you create single-file game images for your PlayStation 5. Instead of handling many loose files from dumped games, this tool bundles everything into one .ffpkg file. This makes it easier to store and transfer your games.

These .ffpkg files work with ShadowMount version 1.4 or higher, which lets you run the games on your jailbroken PS5 console. Keep in mind, this app does not create installable PKG files for Package Installer. Its sole purpose is to package dumped game folders into .ffpkg format using UFS2 technology.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

To use this tool, your computer and console need to meet these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or newer, macOS 10.15 or newer, or a recent version of Linux
- **Processor:** Any modern CPU with at least 2 cores
- **Memory:** Minimum 4 GB RAM
- **Storage:** Enough free space for your dumped game folders plus the final .ffpkg file
- **PlayStation 5:** Jailbroken with ShadowMount 1.4 or higher installed

## 🚀 How to Use TheWiz-PS5-Easy-FFpkg-Maker

Once you open the app, creating a .ffpkg image is straightforward:

1. **Prepare your dumped game folder**  
   Make sure your game files are organized in a single folder. This folder is what you will convert into a .ffpkg image.

2. **Select the folder**  
   In the app, click the button to select your dumped game folder. Browse your computer and pick the correct folder.

3. **Set the output destination**  
   Choose where the app should save the created .ffpkg file. You can use the default location or pick a folder you prefer.

4. **Start the packaging process**  
   Click the button to create the .ffpkg image. The app will combine all files inside that dumped folder into one single .ffpkg file.

5. **Wait for completion**  
   The process might take several minutes depending on the size of your game folder. The app will notify you when it finishes.

6. **Transfer the .ffpkg to your PS5**  
   Use a USB drive or a network share to move the .ffpkg file to your jailbroken PlayStation 5.

7. **Mount the .ffpkg on your PS5**  
   On your PS5, open ShadowMount. Use it to mount the .ffpkg file so you can run the game.

## 🔧 Additional Tips

- **Keep ShadowMount updated**  
  Make sure your PS5 runs ShadowMount version 1.4 or later. Older versions may not support .ffpkg files.

- **Folder structure matters**  
  Your dumped game folder should maintain the original file and subfolder structure from the dump. Avoid renaming files or moving them.

- **Use USB 3.0 for transfers**  
  Copying large .ffpkg files is faster with a USB 3.0 drive or better.

- **Backup original dumps**  
  Always keep a copy of your original dumped game folder before packaging.

- **Check free space**  
  Ensure you have enough disk space for the exported .ffpkg file, as it can be as large or larger than the folder.
